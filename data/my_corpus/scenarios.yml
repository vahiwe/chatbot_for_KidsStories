  - I will take you there right away. What is wrong?
  - I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105 !
  - I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the back door right now, that would be great.
  - I will make sure that I do that before you get here.
  - Also, make sure that we have your driver 's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room.
  - I am getting them out while I am speaking to you.
  - Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?
  - It is near the bridge that crosses over the river.
  - I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there !
- - I 'm calling today about a bill that I never received.
  - Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
  - It was for my Master Card.
  - You should 've gotten that bill two weeks ago.
  - I have n't got it in the mail yet.
  - The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.

  - Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office 's fault?
  - If that 's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake.

  - You are very welcome. Have a good day.

  - What kind would you like?
  - What kind of internet is there?
  - You can get DSL or dial-up.
  - Which of those two is best?
  - I would recommend DSL.
  - Is that one better?
  - It 's better because it does n't tie up your phone.
  - What do you mean by that?
  - DSL is n't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
  - So then I ca n't use my phone if I 'm on the internet?
  - That 's correct. With DSL you can do both.
- - I need to get internet.
  - Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
  - What kind of internet can I get?
  - There is dial-up or DSL.
  - Which one do you feel is best?
  - I would get DSL if I were you.
  - DSL is better than dial-up?
  - It 's the best choice ; plus, it wo n't tie up your phone line.
  - I 'm not sure what that means.
  - Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
  - That 'll make it impossible for me to use.
  - Exactly. With DSL you do n't have that problem.
- - I 'd like to have internet for my computer.
  - Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
  - What are my options for the internet?
  - You can either get dial-up or DSL.
  - Which one would you recommend?
  - DSL is the best choice.
  - Why is DSL better?
  - It 's a lot better because it does n't tie up your phone line.
  - What exactly does that mean?
  - Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
  - That means that I ca n't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right?
  - That 's right. You wo n't have that problem with DSL.
- - I am calling about my cable service.
  - What 's the problem?
  - For the past week my cable has n't been working.

  - You wo n't pay anything until your service starts working again.

  - Thanks, I appreciate your help.

  - It has n't been working the past few days.

  - I 've been having this problem for the last few days.
  - Will the internet even pop up?
  - It 'll pop up, but it wo n't connect to a webpage.
  - Since the internet is n't broken, your connection must be messed up.
  - Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it?
  - If you 'd like, I can send someone to fix it right now.
  - How long will it be till they get here?
  - It should be no longer than an hour.
- - I am interested in buying auto insurance.
  - Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
  - Yes, I brought everything with me.
  - Is your car with you?
  - Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
  - Wonderful. Let 's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
  - OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
  - I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
  - What else do I need to consider for the auto insurance?
  - Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well.
- - Good morning, I need to buy car insurance for the used car I just bought.
  - Yes, no problem. Do you have your registration and Certificate of Ownership with you?
  - Yes, it is all right here.
  - Did you drive your car here?
  - Yes, it is out in the back.
  - That 's great. We 'll go out and check the condition of your car.
  - I understand, what should I insure my car for?
  - There is a Blue Book price for your car and we will use that price.
  - What other things do I need to insure for?
  - We will factor in damage to the other car as well as property damage and injury.

  - We can take care of that right now. Do you have all of your paperwork with you?
  - Yes, I took care of all of that and have the papers with me.
  - Did you bring your car with you?
  - Yes, it is parked on the street.
  - Fine, I need to go out with you to check your car for wear and tear.
  - Fine, how will I know how much I should insure my car for?
  - After looking at your car, I will use the Blue Book price and we will consider the condition of the car.
  - Are there other considerations when I insure my car?
  - We always need to think about property damage, damage to other vehicles, and injury.
- - What kind of car insurance do you have?
  - I went with the Automobile Club.
  - Why did you choose that company?
  - I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
  - What should I think about in choosing services?
  - There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
  - What did you end up buying for your auto insurance?
  - Well, my car is very old, so I did n't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else 's car.
  - Have you ever had to use your insurance?
  - I never had to use my insurance.
- - When you insured your car, what kind did you buy?
  - I decided to buy from GEICO.
  - What influenced your choice of companies?

  - Every individual has different considerations. Your agent can help you understand what you need to think about.
  - What did you place an emphasis on when you bought your insurance?
  - I carry a lot of liability insurance because I own a house and need to protect it from a lawsuit.
  - Did you ever get into an accident and need your insurance?
  - I was in an accident and was happy that I had good insurance to cover it.
- - What car insurance company did you decide to go with when you bought your new car?
  - State Farm seemed like the best deal for me.
  - How did you make that decision?
  - I compared rates and services available.
  - Where can I get help in figuring out what I need to purchase for coverage?
  - You can pick up a pamphlet at your insurance company that will explain the options to you.
  - What did you decide to cover yourself for?
  - I pretty much carry the average amount in all categories as the agent recommended.
  - How many times have you actually used your insurance?
  - I was in an accident, but it was the other person 's fault and their insurance covered it.
- - I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.
  - Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?
  - I already took care of that yesterday.
  - That 's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?
  - Yes, I think we 've agreed upon a fair price.
  - Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?
  - Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.
  - That 's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive your car home?
  - That would be a great help !
  - Glad to be of help.
- - That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.
  - From what I see, it 's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?
  - A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.
  - It 's good that you took care of that. Have you agreed upon a price with the seller?
  - Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I 'm good with that.
  - Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?
  - Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union.
  - You are very well prepared ! I could go with you to talk to the seller and help you get your car home.
  - I appreciate the offer of help !
  - It would be my pleasure to help you.
- - I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.
  - It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take a look at it just to be sure.
  - My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.
  - That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a price?
  - Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.
  - Have you thought about how to pay for your car?
  - I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.
  - You 've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment and drive your car home for you.
  - That would make it a lot easier for me.
  - I am glad that can help. Let 's go take care of that right now.
- - I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
  - You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?
  - I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
  - How long have you been in your current home?
  - I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
  - As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
  - Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
  - It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.
  - What is the next step in selling my home?
  - I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.
- - I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
  - I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When were you thinking of selling your home?
  - I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own.
  - Have you owned your home for a long time?
  - I just bought my home two years ago.
  - I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
  - Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
  - It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
  - What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
  - If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract.
- - I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.
  - It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you interested in selling in the near future?
  - I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii.
  - Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
  - The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away.
  - Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.
  - Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?
  - It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
  - What should we be doing to get the process started?
  - If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.
- - Thank you for coming to look at my house.
  - I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.
  - When will people come to look at my house?
  - Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.
  - Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office?
  - Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
  - Will I know when people are going to come see my house?
  - We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
  - What happens during an Open House day?
  - You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the details.
- - I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.
  - It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.
  - How do you show my home to potential buyers?
  - We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.
  - Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?
  - We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who do n't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
  - How will I know when to expect prospective house buyers?
  - That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours notice.
  - Can I stay home during an Open House day?
  - The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle the showing of your home.
- - Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.
  - I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.
  - When can people come and see my home?
  - We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show your house during the week.
  - Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers?
  - Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.
  - Can people just drop in anytime they feel like the house?
  - We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.
  - Will I have to go away during an Open House day?
  - I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else !
- - How much do you think that I should ask for my house?
  - Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
  - What do you look at when setting an asking price for the house?
  - We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
  - Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
  - No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
  - Is n't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
  - You should n't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
  - Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home does n't sell?
  - Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
- - I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
  - We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
  - What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?
  - The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth.
  - Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home?
  - You do n't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
  - Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?
  - You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
  - Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?
  - We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we are n't getting any offers.
- - What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
  - There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
  - What is involved in figuring out an asking price?
  - We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
  - When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?
  - You do n't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
  - I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
  - Do n't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.
  - Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price is n't bringing in any offers?
  - If the market does n't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it.
- - I am interested in buying a house and need some information.
  - Yes, of course. What area are you interested in?
  - I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia.
  - What size house would you like?
  - We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
  - Are you interested in being in a particular school district?
  - Yes, we want to stay in the ABC School District.
  - Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view?
  - I would love to have a home with a view.
  - Fine, I will begin a search for the perfect home for you. I will call you in a few days.
- - I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you.
  - I can help you. What location are you looking for?
  - I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia.
  - Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size?
  - We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.
  - Is living in a particular school district important to you?
  - No, we do n't really care because they are all pretty good around here.
  - Are you interested in purchasing on the lake, or would you like a home with a view?
  - We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat.
  - Now that I have an idea of what you want, I can begin my search.
- - I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.
  - I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house?
  - I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions.
  - How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
  - We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home.
  - Do you need to be located in a particular school district?
  - It does n't matter, as we do not have any children.
  - Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?
  - In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.
  - Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.
- - I 'd like to reserve a hotel room.
  - That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?
  - My name is John Sandals.
  - Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Chatterbot. What days do you need that reservation, sir?

  - No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please?

  - My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th.
  - We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
  - It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
  - It 's $ 308 a night.
  - I have no problem with that.
  - Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
  - Definitely nonsmoking. I ca n't handle that smell.
